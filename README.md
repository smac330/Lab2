Name: Lab 2 : Simple Email

Description: This is a simple clone of the popular Gmail app, coded with Kotlin with the help of CodePath.
My main goal with this lab is to learn how to implement one of the most common screens in mobile apps: scrolling lists.  
In Android, RecyclerView makes it easy to display lists of data, and this lab will help me get comfortable working with RecyclerViews.
