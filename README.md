This is a simple clone of the popular Gmail app.  

My main goal with this lab is to learn how to implement one of the most common screens in mobile apps: scrolling lists.  

In Android, RecyclerView makes it easy to display lists of data, and this lab will help me get comfortable working with RecyclerViews.
